Note: If we want to use Maven for deploying our web archives, we must configure Tomcat as a server in Maven's settings.xml file.

There are two locations where the settings.xml file may be found:

The Maven install: ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml
A users install: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml

An example of settings.xml is found in etc/.m2/settings.xml
